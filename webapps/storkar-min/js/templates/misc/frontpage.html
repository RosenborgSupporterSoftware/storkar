<div id="hei"><h1 align="center">Dashboard</h1><!--<div id="upcomingmatches"></div><div id="previousmatches"></div>--><div style="margin:25px;">The plan for this page is to present the closest upcoming matches within
some timeframe(per league),and the previous couple of matches played.To implement this,the matches section must be implemented first,which
depends on all the other sections.Still a bit off,in other words...<p><h2>ChangeLog</h2><dl><dt>2015-08-02</dt><dd>Team detail view and editor is starting to be more like I want them.More sections will be added to team detail view though.Probably more like
a tabbed view.</dd><dt>2015-07-29</dt><dd>Selection combobox for editing player-team has been implemented.Country will stay as a two-letter country code input field for now.The backend presto server has been significantly optimized.</dd><dt>2015-07-28</dt><dd>Players section is more or less completed,with the exception of
attaching players to teams(by uuid)from combo-box,and a combo-box for
editing nationality.Player headshots needs transparent background
instead of white.Teams section is next for a facelift.</dd></dl></div></div>
